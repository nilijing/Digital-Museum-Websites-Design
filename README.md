# Digital-Museum-Websites-Design

The public's visit to physical museums is often restricted by time and space. For museums, some collections are more precious. They are not shown to the audience for the protection of cultural relics, which is not conducive to the spread of social culture. Therefore, the establishment of an online museum website is particularly important. Online museum websites can use Internet technology to digitally process the collections in the museum and convert them into information products and then spread them all over the world through the Internet so that people can visit the museum anytime, anywhere, and form effective use and sharing of resources. Therefore, this project uses JavaScript, Visual Studio, and MySQLto design a digital information system for exhibition museums, aiming to promote the digital communication and sharing of museum information.
